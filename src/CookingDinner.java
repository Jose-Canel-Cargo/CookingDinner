// Purpose:    The purpose of this program is to allow an user to choose a meal from each of the 3 different classes,         //
//             BackyardBBQ, ThanksgivingDinner, and HeartyStew. All of them must properly implement the interface Meal_Cook.  //
//             Each of the dinner classes include various meals of which to choose, BackyardBBQ includes a regular and a      //
//             gluten free menu with 4 meals each, ThanksgivingDinner has 4 sides options but allows to pick 2 to go along    //
//             with the turkey, and HeartyStew has a Crocktop and Stovetop menu with 4 meals each. All of these have their    //
//             own preparation that will display with the cook() method from Meal_Cook at the end of the program.             //
