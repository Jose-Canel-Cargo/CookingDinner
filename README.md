# Project Requirements:

For this project, four Classes must be created:

- BackyardBBQ: Uses a charcoal or propane grill to cook a backyard BBQ.
- ThanksgivingDinner: Uses an oven and a roasting pan to cook a turkey.
- HeartyStew: Uses a crockpot or stovetop pot to cook a stew.
- CookingDinner: Has a runnable main() method which will instantiate an object of each Class and print the status of each object.

The first three classes (BackyardBBQ, ThanksgivingDinner, and HeartyStew) must implement the interface Meal_Cook which was supplied to us.
Finally, we were free to select any attributes and methods for each of the Classes.

## Purpose:

In this program, a user will have the opportunity to choose a meal (or two side dishes in the case of ThanksgivingDinner) from each of the
Classes. BackyardBBQ and HeartyStew include two kinds of menus, each with four different meals, that the user can pick from so they may
select their meal. ThanksgivingDinner instead allows the user to pick two side dishes to accompany the Turkey while preventing the user
from picking the same dish twice. When done, the program will print the preparation method and status of each of the meals and dishes that 
were picked.

An extra Class called InputCorrection was added to contain two methods (Included in the [EventPlanner repository](https://github.com/Jose-Canel-Cargo/EventPlanner)) which allows the user
to make corrections after every input if desired. One method is used for Strings while the other is used for integers.
